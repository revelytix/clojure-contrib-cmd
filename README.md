## Overview

This repository contains a copy of the [command
line](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib/blob/master/modules/command-line/src/main/clojure/clojure/contrib/command_line.clj)
library found in the 1.2 version of [Clojure
Contrib](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib). It is intended
to help [Revelytix Inc.](http://revelytix.com) transition from Clojure
1.2 to Clojure 1.3. This library is useful for other projects that
want to upgrade to Clojure 1.3, but don't have the time or don't want
to upgrade to the new [command line
library](https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli). This library will work
on Clojure 1.3 and does not rely on the Clojure 1.2 monolithic
contrib.
